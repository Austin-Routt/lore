## ‚ú® Overview

Lore is an educational project, based on the [Loremaster 6000 project](https://github.com/dottxt-ai/demos/lore-generator), which demonstrates how to build a RAG-powered system for creating and managing fictional worlds. Through Jupyter notebooks, it shows how to:

- Generate coherent, interconnected lore using constrained language models
- Store and retrieve world elements using semantic search
- Maintain consistency across a growing body of fictional content
- Query and analyze relationships between different aspects of your world

## üéÆ Features

- **Guided World Generation**: Create foundational aspects of your world with structured prompts
- **Semantic Lore Storage**: Store and retrieve lore using ChromaDB's vector capabilities
- **Consistency Checking**: Ensure new lore aligns with existing world elements
- **Relationship Analysis**: Explore connections between different parts of your world
- **Interactive Tutorials**: Learn through hands-on Jupyter notebooks

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook/Lab
- Required packages (install via requirements.txt)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Austin-Routt/lore.git
cd lore
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Quick Start

1. Open `lore.ipynb` for a simple introduction
2. Explore `lore.ipynb` further for more complex features

## üìö Examples

### Lore Generation

```python

# Initialize manager
lore_manager = LoreManager(
    model_path="path/to/model",
    embeddings_path="path/to/embeddings"
)

# Create world
world = World(
    setting=SettingType.horror,
    world_description="A massive dark fantasy work with themes of cosmic horror"
)

# Generate lore proposal
proposal = lore_manager.propose_lore(world, "basic principles")

# Refine proposal
final_lore = lore_manager.refine_proposal(proposal, world)

```

### Querying Relationships
```python
analysis = lore_manager.query_lore(
    "How do basic principles affect key powers?"
)
```
